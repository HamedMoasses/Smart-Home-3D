# Smart-Home-3D

In this project, we simulate an IoT based Smart-Home using ZigBee and WiFi in order to detect gas leakage detection in MATLAB's 3D environment, couple of papers are used to form this simulation project which is listed at the bottom of this post. In this project, we provide a multi-sensor system including heating and air conditioning sensors as well as an activation program for home users. In this system, when the gas leaks, the sensors installed in different parts of the simulation environment (home) will feel this problem and will start sending messages through the zigzag standard, and the windows will be opened for gas to escape. There is also a sensor-based intelligent network control system for energy control in this smart home (which is still under development). In the simulation output, we compare the energy consumption between Wifi and ZigBee standard. The full details of the project will be uploaded to a YouTube tutorial video.
